exptTools_VERSIONINFOPlease edit this file to document changes to exptTools every time anew version is archived.  There is no record prior to 10-17-98version.When you archive a new version of exptTools, rename the current versionon unix to have its date of creation (from ls -l) in its name, followingthe examples in the exptToolsOld directory.-------------------------------------------------------11/5/99 (Bill Press, Bob Dougherty, and Ben Backus)Many little things have changed since the last VERSIONINFO update.Among these:* ScreenTools:  - loadDisplayParams replaces usePredefinedDisplay and initDisplayStruct.    Platform independent (yay!)  - openScreen platform independent  CalibrationTools:  - calibGamma samples more efficiently  - the cmeter calls no longer hang if the meter turns itself off  DataAnalysisTools:  - some goodies have been added for function fitting and error bar plotting  ExptToolsMex:  - serial allows direct serial port character printing.  Good for    triggering the 3T  StimGenTools:  - Cleaned up makePeriodic routines  - Cleaned up and added some more functionality to addFixation    Went through serious contortions to keep it backwards compatable.-------------------------------------------------------3/9/99 (Bob Dougherty, Bill Press, and Ben Backus)Again, many little bug fixes and a few major changes and additions (* indicatesa vital change that may affect many experiments):* StimGenTools:  - generateColormaps, generateImages, and generateSequence have all been    made obsolete by makePeriodicStimulus and its associated routines.  The	generate routines had a bug that caused stimuli specified in LMS coordinates	to have incorrect contrasts.  Code that uses generate routines should be	modified to use the makePeriodicStimulus routines.  - makePeriodicStimulus, makePeriodicColormaps, makePeriodicImages, and    makePeriodicSequence allow one to create periodic stimuli flexibly and	easily.  see 'help makePeriodicStimulus' for details on how to use it.  - created addFixation, a more general fixation point routine.  - created buildSimpleSeq and viewStimulus.    StaircaseTools:  - doStaircaseWithFiles takes care of the file/data management, in addition  	to running the staircase.  DisplayTools:  - countDown has been changed to remove the last number ("1") from the    screen before leaving the routine, instead of making the first stimulus	take care of this (which it doesn't if it's very small).	  ColorTools:  - Allow one to use the maximum cone contrast as the maximum cone contrast,    instead of giving an error when they differ by even less than 0.001.  MiscTools:  - Added deg2rad, rad2deg, and saveImages.	  ScreenTools:  - getFramesPer was modified to accomodate the makePeriodicStimulus    params conventions.-------------------------------------------------------12/04/98 (Bob Dougherty)Numerous bug fixes and changes.  Here are the highlights (* indicatesa vital change that may affect many experiments):  StaircaseTools:    DoStaircase now works well (see that file for details    on the changes)* ColorTools:  - cone2rgb now takes account of the background when computing the RGB    values necessary to achieve the requested LMS contrasts.  While this    change does not affect cone-isolating stimuli, it is quite significant    for non-isolating stimuli (including greyscale stimuli!).  Prior to this    modification, non-isolating stimuli were not producing the requested LMS    contrasts for most backgrounds (including the default).  For example:        Èlms.dir = [1 1 1]';        Èlms.scale = .5;        Èrgb = cone2rgb(display, lms);        Èrgb2conecontrast(display, rgb)        ans =           0.35102418394584           0.39132259891944           0.50000000000000    Now, if you request LMS = [1 1 1]*.5, you get LMS = [1 1 1]*.5!    (see cone2rgb and findMaxConeScale for details)  * DisplayTools:  - getting 10-bit color resolution is now easy.  See tenBit2eightBit.m    for details.  Also check out 10bitDemo.m and the GaborStairDemo, both    in exptToolsDemos, for examples on how to use the new 10 bit code.    (Note that this 10-bit code is specifically designed to work with our    Radius 10-bit DAC video cards.)  ScreenTools  - createImagePointers now makes more efficient use of memory.    StimGenTools:    generateColormaps can now do Gaussian temporal envelopes.    -------------------------------------------------------10/17/98 and 10/20/98 versions:10/17/98 is the last version of exptTools that contains the functionsshowTrial, showScan, and showStaircase. In later versions, thesefunctions have been replaced with doTrial, doScan, and doStaircase.The stimulus and trial structures used by the "do" functions arenot the same as those used by the "show" functions.  The new functionsare designed to be more flexible.  To use the old version of exptToolson the mac, run the script 'oldExptToolsPath.m' which will prepend the10-17-98 version of exptTools to the matlab path. The file exptTools.tar.gz, dated 10/20/98, contains exptTools_101798 andthe new "do" version of 10/20/98. BTB 10/20/98-------------------------------------------------------
