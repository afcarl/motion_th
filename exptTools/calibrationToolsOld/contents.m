% This directory should contain everything you need to do monitor calibrations.% To calibrate your monitor, first set up the Photo Research PR-650: mount it on% a tripod, plug in the battery pack (make sure to charge it beforehand), and% connect the supplied cable with the phone port in back of the mac.  The% scripts are what you will need to run to perform the calibration:% % calibGamma.m: This script generates the gamma table for your monitor.% 	Make sure to set the gammaFile name to something appropriate (usually% these names are a concatination of the monitor and card, such as% NecLcd2000Radius10-bit, since the "monitor" and "card" variables sent to% initDisplayStruct will look for a the calibration file by this convention).% Note that when the calibration is finished you will copy this file into the% MRI:GammaTables directory so that it is in the proper search path.% 	The monitor number should be 0, unless you are at Vermillion and you% want to calibrate the LCD monitor, in which case it should be set to 1.% Make sure the frequency and monitor size are set correctly (check the% Monitors & Sound control panel).% 	If you have the time, keep testLinearity equal to 1.  This will double% the time the calibration takes, but it's probably worth it.  If you can't do% the linearity check, you can run it later by running testGamma, passing in% the variable gammaFile.% % calibSpectra.m: This script generates the spectra file for you monitor.% Set the variables as you did for the gamma calibration.  The gamma file% for the monitor will need to be read in, so make sure that what you type% in corresponds to the most recent calibration.% % LMS.m: This script tells you the RGB color direction for a given% cone color direction.  It also gives the maximum RGB contrast for this% color direction.% % Contents:% % calibGamma.m% calibrateDisplay.m% calibSpectra.m% checkMonitorValues.m% checkRange.m% cmeterDownload.m% cmeterGetSynch.m% cmeterGetTime.m% cmeterMeasureSpectra.m% cmeterNECgamma.m% cmeterNECspectra.m% cmeterOneMeas.m% coneSpectra% interpPR650.m% LMS.m
