% The main data structure required to control the screen is called% "display."  An instance of the display structure is created by calling% initDisplayStruct with an appropriate set of parameters.  Paramters% are defined in m-files such as display452.m and displayLucasNEC.m or% as in the demo programs.  An example display structure is shown below.%display structure:display =     screenNumber: 0       numColors: 256   reservedColor: [1x3 struct]  (see below)      pixelDepth: 10        distance: 40       pixelSize: 0.0288       frameRate: 75      gammaTable: [256x1 double]       windowPtr: 39120384            rect: [0 0 832 624]   displayScreen: [0 1]	      reservedColor[n] =            name: 'background'           fbVal: 0          gunVal: [127 127 127]
