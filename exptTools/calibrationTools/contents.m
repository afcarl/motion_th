% Updated 9/12/00 by David Ress%% This directory contains to do monitor calibrations.%% Preparation:% Set up the Photo Research PR-650: mount it on% a tripod, plug in the battery pack/power-supply. It connects to the% Macintosh using two cables. The first is a black cable with a mil-spec% bayonette connector on the camera end, and a special RS-232 connector % on the other end. On the RS-232 end, there is also a small toggle switch% with two settings: ctrl and xfer. It must be set to ctrl to do the calibration.% The second cable is a standard Macintosh modem-port cable with an RS-232% connector on one end and a DIN-9 connector on the other. Connect the photometer% cable to the former, and connect the latter to the Macintosh modem serial port.%% IMPORTANT: Do not turn the photometer on until the script prompts you to do so!% The photometer powers up in remote mode by default. If it doesn't establish% communication with the Macintosh within a couple seconds, it goes into manual% mode and will not communicate further with the computer. Thus, a cmeter('Init')% command must be executed shortly after the photometer is connected to the Mac% and first powered on.%% NOTE:% On older Macs (before G3), a modem serial port was standard. On newer Macs,% you will need to convert the internal modem port (with telephone connector) % to a serial port using either a Griffin gPort or GeeThree.com Stealth card.% % calibGamma.m: This script generates the gamma table for your monitor.% OUTPUT:% 	By default the results will be written to the Desktop as the file% 'gamma.mat'. If you want something else, set the variable gammaFile% to a full file specification, e.g., 'Ochre3:Desktop Folder:Calibration:myGamma.mat'% When the calibration is finished you will copy this file into the% MRI:Displays:whatever directory, where "whatever" is the name of the% display that you're calibrating. Usually, it will be the "default"% display. Regardless of what you named the file at calibration time,% it must be named gamma.mat in the Displays:whatever directory.% Parameters:% 	We assume a two-monitor setup by default. For a one-monitor setup, set% the variable monitor = 0.% 	Make sure the frequency and monitor size are set correctly (check the% Monitors & Sound control panel).% 	If you have the time, set the variable testLinearity = 1.  This will double% the time the calibration takes, but it's probably worth it.  If you can't do% the linearity check, you can run it later by running testGamma, passing in% the variable gammaFile.% % calibSpectra.m: This script generates the spectra file for a monitor.% OUTPUT:% 	By default the results will be written to the Desktop as the file% 'spectra.mat'. When the calibration is complete you will copy this file% into the MRI:Displays:whatever directory, where "whatever" is the name % of the display that you're calibrating. Usually, it will be the "default"% display. Regardless of what you named the file at calibration time,% it must be named spectra.mat in the Displays:whatever directory.% Parameters:% 	We assume a two-monitor setup by default. For a one-monitor setup, set% the variable monitor = 0.% 	Make sure the frequency and monitor size are set correctly (check the% Monitors & Sound control panel).% % LMS.m: This script tells you the RGB color direction for a given% cone color direction.  It also gives the maximum RGB contrast for this% color direction.% % Contents:% % calibGamma.m% calibrateDisplay.m% calibSpectra.m% checkMonitorValues.m% checkRange.m% cmeterDownload.m% cmeterGetSynch.m% cmeterGetTime.m% cmeterMeasureSpectra.m% cmeterNECgamma.m% cmeterNECspectra.m% cmeterOneMeas.m% coneSpectra% interpPR650.m% LMS.m
