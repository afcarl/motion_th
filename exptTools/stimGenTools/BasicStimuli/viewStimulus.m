function viewStimulus(display, stimulus, runPriority, nCycles)% function viewStimulus(display, stimulus, [runPriority], [nCycles])%% Show a single stimulus, as built by createStimulusStruct. % Image pointers are built on the fly.  If you've got a big stimulus that%    you want to view several times, and you don't want to rebuild the %    stimulus pointers every time, then open this function and use its%    various parts separately.  (The problem is that the display must be%    open to create the image pointers, and then they're no good after the%    display has been closed.)% If display structure, including any special reserved colors, already exists%    then call with display as first argument.  If not, then call with [] as%    first argument.%% 2/17/99 Ben Backusif isempty(display)  display = usePredefinedDisplay;enddisplay = openScreen(display);if ~exist('runPriority', 'var') runPriority = 0; endif ~exist('nCycles', 'var') nCycles = 1; enddisp('Creating image pointers...');stimulus = createImagePointers(display, stimulus);showTiming = 1;for iCycle = 1:nCycles  showStimulus(display,stimulus,runPriority,showTiming);endscreen('CloseAll');
