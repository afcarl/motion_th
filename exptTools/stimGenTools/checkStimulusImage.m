function checkStimulusImage(img,cmap)% % AUTHOR:% DATE:% PURPOSE:%   There is an offset of 1 between the image coding in Matlab% and the image coding we use on the Macs via the Toolbox.  Also,% we are building the images as 8 bit quantities, not as% conventional Matlab doubles% % So, to check whether a stimulus looks OK, we need to make this% call.  This manages the proper table addressing and casting.% cmap = double(cmap)/255;img = double(img) + 1;colormap(cmap); image(img);return;
