# motion_th: motion direction discrimination

This software implements a motion direction discrimination task. To run it, use either motion_th_teach.m, motion_th_test.m or motion_th_train.m, with their associated params files. 

## Dependencies

The software requires Matlab and the [The Psychtoolbox](http://www.psychtoolbox.org/HomePage)
